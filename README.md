# Reverse-Polish-Notation


Reverse Polish notation (RPN) is a mathematical notation in which every operator follows all of its operands, in contrast to Polish notation, which puts the operator in the prefix position.

For the given project, I have identified two key areas which can/may have variations;

The methods by which we provide the data <- Lets call it Process
The algorithm, Reverse Polish Notation and Polish Notation <- Lets call it Notation
So I decided to create interfaces for Notation and Process. Hence, we have list of classes under sub-folder 'Process' and 'Notation'
